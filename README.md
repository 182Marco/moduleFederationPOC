# React Widget Playground

In this playground we can see a Proof-of-Concept of a React app embedded as a widget, in which every element that satisfies a certain selector is initialized as a React app in an external index.html file which has no ties to React or the widget itself.

Run `npm run build` in the react-app directory to build the dist directory which will be used by the root index.html file.
